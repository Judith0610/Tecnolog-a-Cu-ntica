<h2>What is quantum technology?</h2>
<p>Quantum technology refers to the use of the principles of quantum mechanics to develop new tools and systems that harness the properties of subatomic particles, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform tasks that would be impossible with classical technologies. Quantum technologies have the potential to revolutionize various fields of science, technology, and society, which could significantly change our way of living and working in the near future.</p>

<h2>Advancements</h2>
<p>These technologies are based on the laws of quantum mechanics and cover various fields, with quantum computing being one of the most relevant. This disruptive approach relies on principles such as quantum superposition and entanglement, enabling a type of computing different from traditional computing. Thanks to its ability to perform multiple operations simultaneously and avoid the tunneling effect that affects programming at the nanometric scale, this new generation of supercomputers uses knowledge of quantum mechanics, focused on atomic and subatomic particles, to overcome the limitations of current computing.</p>
<p>Also, in the field of communications, quantum networks have a clear application in cybersecurity, thanks to advances in data encryption, such as the new Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system for sending sensitive information, which uses light signals to detect any intrusion in the system.</p>
<p>As for devices, quantum sensors take advantage of quantum principles to measure phenomena with great precision, such as the detection of gravitational waves or magnetic fields.</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>The basis of quantum technology lies in quantum mechanics, a theory developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena at very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Although it was not "invented" by a single person, several scientists were key to the development of this theory:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Max Planck (1900):</strong> Introduced the idea that energy is not emitted continuously, but in discrete packets called "quanta." This led to the concept of energy quantization, which is one of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</li>
  <li><strong>Albert Einstein (1905):</strong> Provided the explanation of the photoelectric effect, showing that light also has a quantum nature. This earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
  <li><strong>Niels Bohr (1913):</strong> Proposed the quantum model of the atom, in which electrons move in specific orbits around the nucleus, which was an important advancement in understanding atomic structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Werner Heisenberg (1927):</strong> Formulated the uncertainty principle, which states that certain properties of particles, such as position and velocity, cannot be known simultaneously with precision.</li>
  <li><strong>Erwin Schrödinger (1926):</strong> Developed the equation that describes how the wave functions representing particles change over time, allowing the modeling of electron behavior in atoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Paul Dirac and others:</strong> Also contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, leading to the formulation of more advanced theories such as quantum electrodynamics (QED).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discovery and Development</h2>
<p>Quantum mechanics is not just an abstract theory; its understanding has led to the development of very advanced technological applications, some of which are being used today.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> Based on the principle that qubits (quantum bits) can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time thanks to quantum superposition, allowing calculations much faster than traditional computers. The concept was proposed by Richard Feynman and David Deutsch in the 1980s, and companies like IBM, Google, and others are developing quantum computers.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantum cryptography:</strong> Uses the principle of quantum entanglement to create ultra-secure communication systems. This is possible because any attempt to intercept a quantum communication alters its state, alerting users that the communication has been hacked. A pioneer in this area was Charles Bennett in the 1980s.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantum sensors:</strong> Use quantum principles to create sensors with much higher precision than conventional ones, allowing the measurement of things like time, acceleration, or magnetic fields with extreme accuracy.</li>
</ul>
